# Schema Detection

Based on Jeffrey Young's Schema Therapy framework.

## What Are Schemas?

**Early Maladaptive Schemas (EMS)** are stable, pervasive patterns of thinking, feeling, and relating that develop in childhood and persist throughout life. They're like lenses through which we see ourselves, others, and the world.

Key characteristics:
- Formed in response to unmet childhood needs
- Self-perpetuating and resistant to change
- Activated by schema-triggering situations
- Often outside conscious awareness

## The Five Domains

Young organizes 18 schemas into five domains based on the core childhood need that wasn't met:

### Domain 1: Disconnection and Rejection
*Unmet need: Secure attachment, safety, acceptance*

**Abandonment/Instability**
> "People I'm close to will leave me."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "Everyone leaves eventually"
- "I can't rely on anyone"
- "They'll get tired of me"

**Mistrust/Abuse**
> "Others will hurt, manipulate, or take advantage of me."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "You can't trust anyone"
- "They're all out for themselves"
- "I have to protect myself"

**Emotional Deprivation**
> "My emotional needs will never be met."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "No one really understands me"
- "I'm always the one giving"
- "I feel empty inside"

**Defectiveness/Shame**
> "There's something fundamentally wrong with me."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "If they really knew me..."
- "I'm not good enough"
- "I'm unlovable"

**Social Isolation/Alienation**
> "I don't belong anywhere."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "I've never fit in"
- "I'm different from everyone else"
- "I'm always on the outside looking in"

### Domain 2: Impaired Autonomy and Performance
*Unmet need: Competence, independence, separate identity*

**Dependence/Incompetence**
> "I can't handle things on my own."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "I need help with everything"
- "I'm not capable of..."
- "What should I do?"

**Vulnerability to Harm or Illness**
> "Catastrophe is imminent."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "What if something bad happens?"
- "It's dangerous out there"
- "I'm always worried about..."

**Enmeshment/Undeveloped Self**
> "I don't know who I am apart from others."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "What do you think I should want?"
- "I'm not sure what I like"
- "I just go along with..."

**Failure**
> "I will inevitably fail."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "Why bother trying?"
- "I always mess things up"
- "I'm not as capable as others"

### Domain 3: Impaired Limits
*Unmet need: Realistic limits, self-discipline*

**Entitlement/Grandiosity**
> "I'm special and deserve special treatment."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "Rules don't apply to me"
- "I shouldn't have to..."
- "They don't appreciate how special I am"

**Insufficient Self-Control/Self-Discipline**
> "I can't control myself or tolerate frustration."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "I just couldn't help it"
- "I need it now"
- "I'll do it later"

### Domain 4: Other-Directedness
*Unmet need: Freedom to express needs, validated feelings*

**Subjugation**
> "I must suppress my needs to avoid conflict or rejection."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "It doesn't matter what I want"
- "I just go along with things"
- "I don't want to cause problems"

**Self-Sacrifice**
> "I must meet others' needs at the expense of my own."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "I'm always the one who..."
- "They need me"
- "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't help"

**Approval-Seeking/Recognition-Seeking**
> "My worth depends on others' approval."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "What will they think?"
- "I need people to like me"
- "Their opinion matters more than mine"

### Domain 5: Overvigilance and Inhibition
*Unmet need: Spontaneity, play, emotional expression*

**Negativity/Pessimism**
> "The worst will happen."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "It probably won't work out"
- "Something will go wrong"
- "I don't want to get my hopes up"

**Emotional Inhibition**
> "I must suppress my emotions."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "I don't like to show how I feel"
- "Emotions are weakness"
- "I keep things to myself"

**Unrelenting Standards/Hypercriticalness**
> "Nothing is ever good enough."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "It should have been better"
- "I could have done more"
- "I'm my own worst critic"

**Punitiveness**
> "Mistakes deserve punishment."

*Linguistic markers:*
- "They got what they deserved"
- "I should have known better"
- "There's no excuse for..."

## The Downward Arrow Technique

A key method for uncovering underlying schemas. Start with a surface concern and probe deeper.

### Basic Structure

1. Person states a concern or reaction
2. Ask: "What's the worst that could happen?"
3. They respond
4. Ask: "And if that happened, what would that mean?"
5. Repeat until you hit bedrock belief

### Example

> Person: "I'm nervous about the presentation."
> You: "What are you worried might happen?"
> Person: "I might mess up in front of everyone."
> You: "And if you did mess up, what would that mean?"
> Person: "They'd all see I don't know what I'm doing."
> You: "And if they saw that, what would that mean about you?"
> Person: "That I'm a fraud. That I don't belong here."
> You: "And if you were a fraud who didn't belong—what would that say about you as a person?"
> Person: "That I'm fundamentally not good enough. That I'll never measure up."

*Schema revealed:* Defectiveness/Failure

### Variations

**"What would be so bad about that?"**
> "So they'd be disappointed—what would be so bad about that?"
> "It would mean I let them down. Again."

**"What does that mean about you?"**
> "They might reject you—what would that mean about you?"
> "That I'm unlovable. That no one will ever really want me."

**"And then what?"**
> "They might leave—and then what?"
> "I'd be alone. Forever. No one would be there."

### Gentle Approach

The downward arrow can feel intrusive. Soften with:
- "I'm curious what's underneath that worry..."
- "If we follow that thought to its conclusion..."
- "What's the fear behind the fear?"

## Schema Activation

Schemas are often dormant until triggered by:

### Schema-Relevant Situations
- Abandonment schema → partner travels for work
- Failure schema → challenging project at work
- Defectiveness schema → intimate moment with new partner

### Probing for Activation
> "Are there certain situations where you reliably feel this way?"
> "When did you first notice this feeling? What triggered it?"
> "What's happening when this belief feels most true?"

## Schema Modes

When schemas are activated, people move into "modes"—temporary states of feeling and behaving:

**Child Modes:**
- Vulnerable Child (scared, sad, lonely)
- Angry Child (enraged at unmet needs)
- Impulsive Child (acts without thinking)

**Maladaptive Coping Modes:**
- Compliant Surrenderer (gives in to schema)
- Detached Protector (numbs out, walls off)
- Overcompensator (acts opposite to schema)

**Healthy Modes:**
- Happy Child (playful, spontaneous)
- Healthy Adult (integrated, balanced)

### Eliciting Mode Awareness
> "When you're in that place—feeling defective—what do you do?"
> "Do you shut down? Push back? Try harder?"

## Schema Origins

Schemas form in childhood. Understanding origin helps with elicitation:

| Schema | Common Origins |
|--------|---------------|
| Abandonment | Parent left, died, or was emotionally unavailable |
| Mistrust | Abuse, betrayal, unpredictable caregivers |
| Emotional Deprivation | Cold or unaffectionate parents |
| Defectiveness | Criticism, rejection, conditional love |
| Failure | Excessive criticism, comparison to siblings |
| Unrelenting Standards | Perfectionist parents, approval contingent on performance |

### Eliciting Origins
> "When you think about where this belief came from..."
> "Was there a time in your life when this felt especially true?"
> "Who first made you feel this way?"

## Schema vs. Situation

Distinguish between:

**Schema-driven response:** Disproportionate, familiar, linked to history
> "I know I'm overreacting, but I can't help it."

**Situational response:** Proportionate, novel, context-specific
> "This is a genuinely difficult situation."

### Probing the Distinction
> "Does this reaction feel familiar? Like you've been here before?"
> "On a scale of 1-10, how big is the situation vs. how big is your reaction?"

## Conversational Detection

### Listen for Absolutes
- "always," "never," "everyone," "no one"
- Often signal schema-level beliefs

### Notice Emotional Intensity
- Strong reactions to mild triggers suggest schema activation
- "That's been a thing for me" usually means schema

### Watch for Themes
- Recurring patterns across different relationships/contexts
- Same feeling in different situations

### Probe Gently
> "It sounds like this is a sensitive area for you."
> "I'm curious if this connects to anything earlier in your life."
