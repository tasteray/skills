# Elicitation

Psychological profiling through natural conversation.

## Goal

When reviewing or creating content related to psychological elicitation—whether conversation scripts, interview questions, user research flows, or any code that implements these techniques—**your goal is to achieve a 10/10 score**.

Score all work on a 0-10 scale based on adherence to the principles and techniques in this skill. Provide your assessment as **X/10** with specific feedback on what's working and what needs improvement to reach 10/10.

A 10/10 means the work:
- Embodies the core principle (depth through patience, not probing)
- Uses appropriate techniques from the research traditions
- Avoids all anti-patterns
- Creates conditions for authentic self-disclosure

Iterate until you reach 10/10.

## Core Principle

**Depth comes from patience, not probing.**

The most revealing information emerges when people feel safe to share, not when they're questioned. Your role is to create conversational space where self-disclosure feels natural and meaningful.

Key insight: People want to tell their stories. They rarely get the chance.

## Three Research Traditions

This skill synthesizes three complementary approaches:

### 1. Autobiographical Memory Research
How memories shape identity. Key finding: **Self-defining memories** (Singer) are the building blocks of personality—vivid, emotionally intense, frequently rehearsed memories linked to enduring concerns.

### 2. Narrative Identity Theory
How people construct life stories. Key finding: The **narrative themes** people use (redemption vs. contamination, agency vs. communion) predict psychological well-being better than the actual events (McAdams).

### 3. Motivational Interviewing
How to facilitate disclosure without resistance. Key finding: **Reflections outperform questions** at eliciting authentic self-disclosure. Aim for 2:1 reflection-to-question ratio (Miller & Rollnick).

## Self-Defining Memories

Jefferson Singer identified five criteria that make a memory "self-defining":

1. **Vivid** - Rich sensory and emotional detail
2. **Emotionally intense** - Strong feeling, positive or negative
3. **Frequently rehearsed** - Comes to mind often, told to others
4. **Linked to similar memories** - Part of a pattern or theme
5. **Connected to enduring concerns** - Reflects ongoing goals, conflicts, or unresolved issues

### Eliciting Self-Defining Memories

Don't ask: "What's your most formative memory?"

Instead, create conversational frames:

**The "keeps coming back" frame:**
> "Some memories just stay with us—they pop into our heads at unexpected moments, or we find ourselves telling them to new people in our lives. Is there a memory like that for you?"

**The "explains who I am" frame:**
> "When you're getting to know someone new and you want them to really understand where you're coming from, is there a story or moment you find yourself sharing?"

**The "turning point" frame:**
> "Looking back, was there a moment that felt like things shifted—where life before and after felt somehow different?"

### What Self-Defining Memories Reveal

| Memory Feature | Personality Insight |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Themes of mastery, achievement | High need for agency |
| Themes of connection, relationships | High need for communion |
| Redemption sequences (bad → good) | Resilience, generativity |
| Contamination sequences (good → bad) | Depression risk, unresolved trauma |
| Integration and meaning-making | Psychological maturity |
| Fragmentation and confusion | Identity diffusion |

## Life Story Interview: 8 Key Scenes

Dan McAdams' Life Story Interview asks for 8 specific "scenes" that reveal narrative identity:

1. **High Point** - Peak experience, most wonderful moment
2. **Low Point** - Nadir, most difficult moment
3. **Turning Point** - Moment of significant change
4. **Earliest Memory** - First clear memory
5. **Important Childhood Memory** - Vivid memory before age 12
6. **Important Adolescent Memory** - Vivid memory from teen years
7. **Important Adult Memory** - Significant recent memory
8. **One Other Important Memory** - Anything else that defines who they are

### Conversational Adaptations

You don't need to ask all 8 sequentially. Instead:

**Open with curiosity, not agenda:**
> "I'm curious about the moments that shaped you. Not necessarily the big resume stuff—more the experiences that stick with you."

**Follow their lead:**
When they mention a period of life, gently explore:
> "What was that time like for you? Any particular moments that stand out?"

**Bridge across time:**
> "That sounds like it mattered. Was there ever a moment earlier—or later—that connected to that same feeling?"

### Narrative Themes to Listen For

**Agency themes** (personal power, achievement, mastery):
- "I decided..."
- "I made it happen..."
- "I pushed through..."

**Communion themes** (connection, love, belonging):
- "We were all together..."
- "I felt so close to..."
- "They understood me..."

**Redemption sequences** (suffering leads to growth):
- "It was terrible, but..."
- "Looking back, I'm glad..."
- "That's what made me who I am..."

**Contamination sequences** (good becomes bad):
- "Things were great until..."
- "I thought I was happy, but..."
- "It ruined everything..."

## OARS Framework

Motivational Interviewing's core skills, adapted for elicitation:

### Open Questions
Questions that can't be answered with yes/no. But use sparingly.

Instead of: "Did you like your childhood?"
Try: "What was it like growing up in your family?"

### Affirmations
Genuine recognition of strengths, efforts, or values—not compliments.

Instead of: "That's great!"
Try: "You valued honesty even when it was costly."

### Reflections
Restate or reframe what they said. This is the core skill.

**Simple reflection** (repeat back):
> "So you felt invisible in that moment."

**Complex reflection** (add meaning):
> "It sounds like recognition really matters to you—like you need to know your contributions are seen."

**Amplified reflection** (gently exaggerate):
> "So nothing they could have done would have made a difference." (Often prompts them to nuance their position)

**Double-sided reflection** (hold both truths):
> "On one hand, you loved the stability. On the other, you felt trapped."

### Summaries
Periodically gather what you've heard. Creates meaning and invites correction.

> "Let me see if I'm following: Growing up, you learned to be self-reliant because asking for help meant disappointment. But you've also noticed that pattern keeping people at a distance now. And you're wondering if there's another way."

### The 2:1 Ratio

**Aim for 2 reflections for every question.**

Questions gather information but can feel like interrogation. Reflections show understanding and invite elaboration.

Bad pattern:
> Q: "What happened?" → Q: "How did that feel?" → Q: "What did you do next?"

Better pattern:
> Q: "What happened?" → R: "That caught you off guard" → R: "You weren't sure what to make of it"

## Values Elicitation

Shalom Schwartz's 10 Universal Values provide a framework for understanding motivation:

| Value | Core Concern |
|-------|--------------|
| **Self-Direction** | Independence, freedom, creativity |
| **Stimulation** | Novelty, excitement, challenge |
| **Hedonism** | Pleasure, enjoyment, gratification |
| **Achievement** | Success, competence, ambition |
| **Power** | Authority, wealth, social status |
| **Security** | Safety, stability, order |
| **Conformity** | Obedience, self-discipline, politeness |
| **Tradition** | Respect, commitment, humility |
| **Benevolence** | Helpfulness, loyalty, forgiveness |
| **Universalism** | Equality, justice, environmental protection |

### Values Elicitation Techniques

**Role model technique:**
> "Who do you admire? What is it about them specifically?"

**Opposite day technique:**
> "What kind of person could you never be? What would feel like a betrayal of yourself?"

**Decision archaeology:**
> "Think of a hard choice you made. What ultimately tipped the scales?"

**Anger as values signal:**
> "What makes you genuinely angry—not annoyed, but morally outraged?"

## Schema Detection

Jeffrey Young's 18 Early Maladaptive Schemas are stable patterns of thinking and feeling that develop in childhood and persist across contexts:

### The Five Domains

**1. Disconnection & Rejection**
- Abandonment, Mistrust/Abuse, Emotional Deprivation, Defectiveness/Shame, Social Isolation

**2. Impaired Autonomy**
- Dependence/Incompetence, Vulnerability to Harm, Enmeshment, Failure

**3. Impaired Limits**
- Entitlement/Grandiosity, Insufficient Self-Control

**4. Other-Directedness**
- Subjugation, Self-Sacrifice, Approval-Seeking

**5. Overvigilance & Inhibition**
- Negativity/Pessimism, Emotional Inhibition, Unrelenting Standards, Punitiveness

### Downward Arrow Technique

When someone expresses a surface concern, gently probe for the deeper belief:

> Person: "I'm worried about the presentation."
> You: "What's the worst that could happen?"
> Person: "I could mess up in front of everyone."
> You: "And if that happened, what would that mean?"
> Person: "They'd see I don't know what I'm doing."
> You: "And what would that mean about you?"
> Person: "That I'm a fraud. That I don't deserve to be here."

The bottom of the arrow often reveals a schema (in this case: Defectiveness/Shame or Failure).

### Linguistic Markers of Schemas

| Schema | Language Patterns |
|--------|-------------------|
| Abandonment | "Everyone leaves eventually..." |
| Defectiveness | "There's something wrong with me..." |
| Failure | "I never finish anything..." |
| Emotional Deprivation | "No one really understands..." |
| Unrelenting Standards | "It's never good enough..." |

## The Reminiscence Bump

People have disproportionately more and more vivid memories from ages 10-30 (the "reminiscence bump"). This is when identity forms.

**Target the bump:**
- First romantic relationship
- First job or career defining moment
- Leaving home
- Key friendships formed
- Educational turning points
- Early adult struggles and triumphs

**Bridge from present to bump:**
> "You mentioned feeling like an outsider at work. Was there a time earlier in life—maybe in school or when you were first starting out—when you felt something similar?"

### Family Theme
- What was the emotional climate of your home?
- Who were you closest to? Who did you clash with?
- What family stories get told and retold?

### Work Theme
- What does work mean to you beyond earning money?
- When have you felt most fulfilled professionally?

## Language Markers for Personality

LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) research identifies patterns, **but use with caution**:

| Pattern | Possible Indication |
|---------|---------------------|
| High "I" usage | Self-focus, possible depression, honesty |
| High "we" usage | Collectivist orientation, intimacy |
| Negative emotion words | Distress, but also processing |
| Cognitive complexity words (because, think, know) | Analytic thinking, meaning-making |
| Present tense focus | Immediacy, possibly impulsivity |
| Past tense focus | Reflection, possibly rumination |

### Critical Caveats

1. **Context matters enormously.** The same word patterns mean different things in different contexts.
2. **Cross-validate.** Never rely on language alone. Triangulate with behavior and explicit statements.
3. **Aggregates, not individuals.** LIWC findings are about group averages. Individual variation is huge.
4. **Cultural differences.** Word usage norms vary dramatically across cultures and languages.

## Anti-Patterns

**What NOT to do:**

### The Interrogation Trap
Rapid-fire questions feel like an interview, not a conversation. People become guarded.

Instead: Slow down. Reflect more, question less.

### The Interpretation Leap
Jumping to psychological conclusions before you have evidence.

Instead: Hold hypotheses lightly. Seek disconfirming evidence.

### The Agenda Push
Steering toward topics you think are important rather than following their energy.

Instead: Let them lead. Their emphasis is data.

### The Premature Depth
Asking deeply personal questions before trust is established.

Instead: Earn disclosure gradually. Start with easier territory.

### The Therapy Cosplay
Using clinical language or techniques that imply you're treating them.

Instead: Be curious, not clinical. You're learning about them, not diagnosing.

### The Monologue Response
Responding to their disclosure with your own lengthy story.

Instead: Keep focus on them. Brief self-disclosure can build rapport, but always return to them.

### The Validation Trap
Agreeing with everything to maintain rapport.

Instead: Genuine reflections can gently challenge without confrontation.
