# Explanation Patterns Guide

How to craft compelling `why_match` explanations that feel personal, not algorithmic.

## Why Explanations Matter

Users don't trust black-box recommendations. Research shows:

- **88%** of users are more likely to try a recommendation they understand (Zhang & Chen, 2020)
- Explanations increase **perceived competence** of the system
- Good explanations reduce **decision fatigue**
- Bad explanations actively **damage trust**

The explanation is not an afterthought—it's where the value is created.

## Anatomy of a Great Explanation

Every effective explanation has four potential components:

### 1. HOOK - Reference Their Context

Start by showing you understand them:

> "You mentioned loving slow-burn tension..."
> "Given your preference for quiet spaces..."
> "Since you're short on time this week..."

The hook establishes: *I see you. This isn't generic.*

### 2. MATCH - Explain the Fit

Connect the item to their context:

> "...this psychological thriller builds dread without jump scares"
> "...this library-like cafe keeps conversations easy"
> "...this 90-minute film packs a full story arc"

The match explains: *Here's why this specific thing fits you specifically.*

### 3. BENEFIT - What They'll Get

Make the value concrete:

> "You'll be thinking about the ending for days"
> "Perfect for the catch-up dinner you mentioned"
> "You can finish it in one sitting tonight"

The benefit answers: *What's in it for me?*

### 4. CAVEAT - Honest Acknowledgment (Optional)

When there are trade-offs, address them:

> "Note: it's slightly over your budget, but the quality justifies it"
> "Heads up: no outdoor seating if the weather's nice"
> "Fair warning: the first 20 minutes are slow, but trust the payoff"

The caveat builds: *Trust through honesty.*

## The Full Formula

```
[HOOK] + [MATCH] + [BENEFIT] + [CAVEAT?]
```

### Example: Movie Recommendation

> "You mentioned loving restaurants where you can hear your conversation **[HOOK]**. This cozy neighborhood spot keeps the music low and tables spaced well **[MATCH]**. Perfect for the catch-up dinner you're planning **[BENEFIT]**. Note: no outdoor seating if the weather's nice **[CAVEAT]**."

### Example: Product Recommendation

> "Since durability matters more to you than brand names **[HOOK]**, this lesser-known Japanese knife holds its edge 3x longer than the German alternatives you've been considering **[MATCH]**. You'll spend less time sharpening and more time actually cooking **[BENEFIT]**. It does require hand-washing—no dishwasher **[CAVEAT]**."

## Confidence-Calibrated Language

Match your language to your confidence score:

### High Confidence (0.9+)

Strong, direct language:
- "This is exactly what you're looking for"
- "Perfect match for your criteria"
- "This hits every point you mentioned"

### Good Match (0.8-0.89)

Confident but not absolute:
- "This fits your preferences well"
- "Strong match across your key criteria"
- "Solidly aligned with what you described"

### Moderate Match (0.7-0.79)

Appropriately hedged:
- "Based on what you've shared, this should work"
- "This matches most of your criteria"
- "Good fit with a few considerations"

### Partial Match (0.6-0.69)

Honest about limitations:
- "This matches some of your criteria"
- "Partial fit—here's where it aligns and where it doesn't"
- "Worth considering despite some gaps"

### Stretch Recommendation (<0.6)

Clearly framed as exploration:
- "This is outside your usual, but..."
- "A stretch pick that might surprise you"
- "Not an obvious match, but hear me out..."

## Personalization Depth Levels

### Level 1: Category Match
Generic, could apply to many users:
> "This thriller has great reviews."

### Level 2: Preference Match
References stated preferences:
> "This thriller matches your love of the genre."

### Level 3: Context Match
References specific context:
> "This slow-burn thriller matches your preference for tension that builds."

### Level 4: Deep Personalization
References specific examples and nuance:
> "This builds tension like Prisoners, which you loved, but without the violence you mentioned avoiding after becoming a parent."

**Always aim for Level 3+.** If you can only achieve Level 1-2, your context is too thin.

## Handling Trade-offs

When recommendations have downsides, address them directly:

### The Honest Caveat

**Don't hide issues:**
> ❌ "Great restaurant for your date!" (omitting that it's noisy)

**Do address them:**
> ✅ "Perfect food for your date, though it gets loud after 8pm—consider an early reservation."

### The Trade-off Acknowledgment

**When constraints are slightly exceeded:**
> "At 135 minutes, it's a bit over your 2-hour preference, but the pacing earns every minute."

**When there's a weakness:**
> "The special effects are dated, but the story and performances more than compensate."

**When it's expensive:**
> "It's at the top of your budget, but for an anniversary, the experience justifies the splurge."

### The Stretch Framing

**When recommending outside preferences:**
> "I know you said you don't usually go for comedies, but this one has the sharp writing you love in dramas. Think of it as a drama that happens to be funny."

## Anti-Patterns

### The Generic Explanation

❌ "This is highly rated and popular."
✅ "Your love of character-driven stories makes this a fit—the ensemble cast is the real draw."

### The Feature Dump

❌ "4K resolution, HDR, 120Hz, OLED panel, 55-inch."
✅ "The 120Hz you wanted for gaming, plus the OLED blacks that make movies pop."

### The Algorithmic Voice

❌ "Users with similar profiles rated this highly."
✅ "People who share your taste for atmospheric thrillers loved this one."

### The Oversell

❌ "This is PERFECT and you'll ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!"
✅ "This fits what you described well—particularly the pacing you mentioned valuing."

### The Undersell

❌ "This might work, I guess."
✅ "This is a strong match for your main criteria, with one consideration..."

### The Missing Hook

❌ "Great restaurant with excellent pasta."
✅ "Since you mentioned craving fresh pasta after your Italy trip, this place makes it in-house daily."
